## Multivariate Time Series Imputation using Transformer Encoder

### Project Overview

This project implements a Transformer Encoder model for multivariate time series imputation. The model is trained to reconstruct missing values in time series data with different masking ratios (12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%). The implementation uses PyTorch and is evaluated on the exchange rate dataset.

### Dataset

The exchange rate dataset contains daily exchange rates of 8 countries from 1990 to 2016. The data is multivariate, with each feature representing a different country's exchange rate. The dataset is stored in `data/exchange_rate.csv`.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalization using StandardScaler
   - Random masking of values with specified mask ratios
   - Sequence length set to 96 as specified

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Transformer Encoder with self-attention mechanism
   - Input projection layer to map features to model dimension
   - Multiple transformer encoder layers
   - Output projection layer to map back to original feature space

3. **Training Process**:
   - Loss calculated only on masked values
   - Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.001
   - Early stopping with patience of 10
   - Learning rate reduction on plateau
   - 100 epochs for each mask ratio
   - Best model saved based on validation loss

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Feature-wise MSE and MAE

### Results

#### Final Evaluation Metrics

| Mask Ratio | MSE      | MAE      |
|------------|----------|----------|
| 12.5%      | 0.02102  | 0.03885  |
| 25%        | 0.06071  | 0.11394  |
| 37.5%      | 0.06071  | 0.11394  |
| 50%        | 0.08271  | 0.15392  |

#### Analysis

The results clearly demonstrate the relationship between mask ratio and imputation performance:

1. **Lower Mask Ratios (12.5%)**: 
   - Best performance with lowest MSE (0.02102) and MAE (0.03885)
   - Training converges quickly and remains stable

2. **Medium Mask Ratios (25%, 37.5%)**: 
   - Moderate performance with MSE of 0.06071 and MAE of 0.11394
   - Training takes longer to converge

3. **Higher Mask Ratios (50%)**:
   - Most challenging scenario with highest MSE (0.08271) and MAE (0.15392)
   - Model struggles more with imputation as less information is available

This pattern is expected and confirms that the model's performance degrades as more data is masked, which is intuitive since the imputation task becomes more difficult with less available information.

#### Training Dynamics

The training and validation loss curves show:

1. **Training Loss**: Decreases steadily for all mask ratios, indicating effective learning
2. **Validation Loss**: Shows more fluctuation, especially for higher mask ratios
3. **Overfitting**: Some evidence of overfitting in later epochs, particularly for higher mask ratios

### Implementation Details

The implementation uses:
- PyTorch for model development
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Apple Silicon GPU (MPS) for accelerated training
- Custom dataset class for handling masked time series data

The main implementation is in `tasks/imputation/using_mps/run_mps_task1.py`, which runs the imputation task on MPS-enabled devices. The model architecture is defined in `models/transformer.py`.

### Visualizations

For each mask ratio, the implementation generates:
- Plots comparing original, observed, and imputed values
- Feature-specific imputation visualizations
- Loss curves and metric trends

These visualizations are saved in the `results/` directory and also logged to Weights & Biases.

### Hyperparameter Analysis

Hyperparameter tuning explored:
- Model dimension: 128
- Number of heads: 2
- Number of transformer layers: 1
- Dropout rates: 0.1, 0.2
- Learning rates: 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001

The best configuration used a model dimension of 128, 2 attention heads, 1 transformer layer, dropout of 0.1, and learning rate of 0.001.

### Conclusion

The Transformer Encoder model successfully performs time series imputation with varying degrees of accuracy depending on the mask ratio. As expected, performance decreases as the mask ratio increases, but even at 50% masking, the model provides reasonable imputation results.

The self-attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture effectively captures temporal dependencies in the data, making it suitable for time series imputation tasks.

### Future Work

Potential improvements and extensions:
1. Hyperparameter tuning (model dimension, number of heads, layers)
2. Learning rate scheduling
3. Different masking strategies (block masking vs. random masking)
4. Comparison with other imputation methods (GRU, LSTM, etc.)
5. Testing on different time series datasets

### Project Overview

This project implements a DLinear model for multivariate time series forecasting. The model is designed to leverage trend decomposition and linear transformations to predict future values in time series data. The implementation uses PyTorch and is evaluated on the exchange rate dataset.

### Dataset

The exchange rate dataset contains daily exchange rates of 8 countries from 1990 to 2016. The data is multivariate, with each feature representing a different country's exchange rate. The dataset is stored in `data/exchange_rate.csv`.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalization using StandardScaler
   - Splitting into train, validation, and test sets
   - Sequence length set to 96 for input
   - Prediction length set to 14 for forecasting

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - DLinear model with trend decomposition
   - Simple yet effective architecture that separates trend and seasonal components
   - Linear transformation applied to the components
   - Individual or shared models for each feature dimension

3. **Training Process**:
   - MSE loss function
   - Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.001
   - Early stopping with patience of 10
   - 100 epochs maximum
   - Best model saved based on validation loss

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### Implementation

The DLinear model is implemented in `models/dlinear.py` and utilizes decomposition to separate trend and seasonal components:

```python
def decompose(self, x):
    # x: [Batch, Input length, Features]
    mean = x.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)
    trend = x - mean
    seasonal = mean
    return trend, seasonal
```

This simple decomposition is paired with linear layers to make predictions:

```python
# Apply linear models
if self.individual:
    trend_output = torch.zeros([x.size(0), self.pred_len, self.n_features], 
                              dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device)
    seasonal_output = torch.zeros([x.size(0), self.pred_len, self.n_features], 
                                dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device)
    
    # Apply individual models for each feature
    for i in range(self.n_features):
        trend_output[:, :, i] = self.trend_linear[i](trend[:, :, i])
        seasonal_output[:, :, i] = self.seasonal_linear[i](seasonal[:, :, i])
else:
    # Transpose and apply shared model
    trend_output = self.trend_linear(trend.transpose(1, 2)).transpose(1, 2)
    seasonal_output = self.seasonal_linear(seasonal.transpose(1, 2)).transpose(1, 2)
```

The training and evaluation code is in `tasks/forecasting/dlinear_forecasting.py`.

# Time Series Forecasting Report - DDPM

## Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models

### Project Overview

This project implements a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for multivariate time series forecasting. The model generates future time series values through an iterative denoising process. The implementation uses PyTorch and is evaluated on the exchange rate dataset.

### Dataset

The exchange rate dataset contains daily exchange rates of 8 countries from 1990 to 2016. The data is multivariate, with each feature representing a different country's exchange rate. The dataset is stored in `data/exchange_rate.csv`.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalization using StandardScaler
   - Splitting into train, validation, and test sets
   - Sequence length set to 96 for input
   - Prediction length set to 14 for forecasting

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - DDPM with a U-Net backbone
   - Diffusion process with 1000 timesteps
   - Conditional generation based on input sequence
   - Time embedding to encode diffusion timestep
   - Feature-preserving architecture

3. **Training Process**:
   - Denoising objective (predicting added noise)
   - Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.001
   - Early stopping with patience
   - 100 epochs maximum
   - Best model saved based on validation loss

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### Implementation

The DDPM model is implemented in `models/ddpm.py` and follows the diffusion process:

```python
def sample(self, x, time_steps=None):
    """
    Sample from the model using the DDPM sampling procedure.
    
    Args:
        x (torch.Tensor): Input sequence of shape [batch_size, seq_len, features]
        time_steps (list): List of diffusion timesteps to use
        
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Generated samples of shape [batch_size, pred_len, features]
    """
    batch_size = x.shape[0]
    
    # Initialize x_t with random noise for the prediction length
    x_t = torch.randn(batch_size, self.pred_len, self.n_features, device=x.device)
    
    # Use default timesteps if none provided
    if time_steps is None:
        time_steps = list(range(0, self.n_timesteps))[::-1]
```

The sampling process involves iterative denoising:

```python
# Iterative denoising
for i in range(1, len(time_steps)):
    t = time_steps[i-1]
    next_t = time_steps[i]
    
    # Time embeddings
    t_emb = self._get_time_embedding(torch.tensor([t], device=x.device))
    
    # Get model prediction (predicts the noise)
    with torch.no_grad():
        predicted_noise = self.noise_predictor(x_t, t_emb, x)
    
    # Calculate coefficients
    at = self.alphas_cumprod[t]
    at_next = self.alphas_cumprod[next_t] if next_t < self.n_timesteps else torch.tensor(0.0)
    
    # Predict x_0
    x_0 = (x_t - torch.sqrt(1 - at) * predicted_noise) / torch.sqrt(at + eps)
```

The training and evaluation code is in `tasks/forecasting/ddpm_forecasting.py`.
